# HealthApp

HealthApp -  is the project aiming to create a healhty habit building application. The idea is to consists of several stages:
- Analyze existing habit building applications
- Learn about habit and addiction formation
- Determine strategies used by popular applications in order to increase screen time of their users
- Study if there are any templates for habit building and addiction quit

The UX/UI design and back-end is done by other team members while the Android application itself is done by me. For now the project is on very fisrt stage of MVP implementation.
